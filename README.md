# passing-data-deeply-with-context

In this documentation read, I learnt:

- `Context` allows a parent component to make data accessible to all its children (no matter how deeply nested they are) without passing it down through props
- Context is an alternative to prop drilling. It really helps out when you need to to pass the same data to many components with most of them deeply nested in the component tree. `It allows a parent component to provide data to the entire tree below it`


:star:**Pro tip**: The ***src*** scripts linked in the html file point to the javascript files that *have been converted from React to plain javascript*
